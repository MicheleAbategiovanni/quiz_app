# Quiz App ~ Flutter 

This is my new Flutter Project.
The Flutter quiz app is an interactive and engaging mobile application that challenges users with a series of questions. Upon starting the quiz, the user is presented with a set of questions, and they must answer each one. After answering the last question, the user is immediately shown their quiz results.

The quiz results display the total number of correct answers and a summary of the questions attempted. For each question, the app informs the user whether their response was correct or incorrect. This allows the user to review their performance and identify which questions they answered correctly and which ones they got wrong.

The app's user-friendly interface and smooth navigation enhance the overall quiz experience. With its simple yet effective design, the Flutter quiz app provides users with an enjoyable way to test their knowledge and learn new things. It's a perfect tool for both educational purposes and fun challenges.

    The next step for the app will be to allow users to select their preferred language for the quiz, choosing between Italian and English. This feature will enhance the app's accessibility and provide a more personalized experience for users, ensuring that they can enjoy the quiz in their preferred language
